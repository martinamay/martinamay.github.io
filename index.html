          <span class="highlightme"> Painter. Writer. Coder. And then there's also my job. </span><p> <br>
            I love creating things - writing stories, building websites, painting canvasas. <br>
            While recruiting for engineers I discovered my interest in tech, and started to get into coding myself. Matching colors to fonts is my
            favourite past time activity and regularly keeps me from completing lines of code.
            I am currently building up the people department for the company I'm working at -  taking care of all things recruitment, performance management, engagement, learning and development.
            Other than that I love exploring my chosen home Berlin, reading books and re-arranging my bookshelves, eating ramen
            and taking photos on my Olympus.
